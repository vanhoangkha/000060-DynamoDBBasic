- **AWS CloudShell** is a browser-based shell that makes it easy to securely manage, discover, and interact with your AWS resources. **CloudShell** is pre-authenticated with your console credentials.
- Common development and operations tools are pre-installed, so no local installation or configuration is required. With CloudShell, you can quickly run scripts with the AWS Command Line Interface **(AWS CLI)**, experiment with AWS service APIs using **AWS SDK**, or use a range of tools other to function effectively.
- You can use CloudShell right from your browser and at no extra cost.
