**Amazon DynamoDB** is a fully managed **NoSQL database** service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. **DynamoDB** allows easing the administrative burden of operating and scaling distributed databases, provisioning hardware, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster expansion. **DynamoDB** also provides encryption at rest. 
- **DynamoDB** creates database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any amount of required traffic. You can scale up or down your capacity through your table without downtime or performance loss. 
- **DynamoDB** provides on-demand backup. It allows you to create full backups of tables for long-term retention and archiving for regulatory compliance needs. 
- We can create on-demand backups and enable point-in-time recovery for Amazon DynamoDB tables. Timed restore helps protect tables from accidental writes or deletes. With the point in time restore, it is possible to restore the table to any point in the last 35 days. 
- **DynamoDB** allows automatic deletion of expired items from the table thus reducing storage usage and data storage costs that are no longer relevant.
